1. Introduction

University students usually seek to join clubs and communities to enhance their social
skills and make new friends. There are many clubs and organizations that can be found within
the UiTM Raubs student community. Engaging in club activities is a good way to fill university
life. Although the community is strongly established, there is no platform for students to find and
discover clubs that exist at their university, especially those that are available on campus.

  Hence, the main objective of the UiTM Raub Club Registration System is to solve this
problem, which helps students discover, join, and engage with clubs across UiTM Raub on a
centralized platform. Students can find and join clubs and organizations of a variety of types and
specialties that align with their interests and goals. A centralized platform helps users keep up to
date with announcements and upcoming events that were organized by their club.
  
  This project also aligns with Universiti Teknologi MARA’s mission to produce ethical,
competent, and globally competitive graduates. By participating in club activities, students can
gain valuable experience in project management, leadership, and high-level decision-making. It
really provides UiTM Raub students with a platform that helps them enhance their potential and
opens up more opportunities for them.
